## How My Week Went 

This is a summary of how my first week of march went because i definitely can't post it all :) .

My first week of March really wasn't too bad. I took a trip to the Moscow Aquarium and that was thee highlight of the week. I attended a sports event (just watched soccer with my friends).I did a lot of school work and studying of course and I also took some walks for fresh air. I also read an article on data science and researched on how to grow myself in that direction.

I could say it was one of my most productive weeks because I was able to get all my work done on time and still had time for life outside school. I created this website during my first week of march as a school assignment but I don't think of it as school work so it can be more fun. I also created a new pinterest board where I'm just kind of posting a story, you can find the link to it on my twitter profile. I did a lot of journaling and I might go back to posting vlogs and videos on youtube because I have gotten used to my schedule (The link to my youtube is on my twitter too) . You can send reccomendations of what you want to see more on my channel. How was your first week of march?

Thanks for reading!
