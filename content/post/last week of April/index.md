## How My Week Went 

What to write, what to write...

Well, April wasn't bad at all. I had some bad days but mostly good days. In the last week of April I really didn't get to much. Just school work and recording youtube videos. 
My mom had her birthday on the 30th (Happy birthday again mom!), and my birthday is coming up soon too. I honestly have no idea what I want to do yet but i'll figure it out, O still have some three weeks. I tried shawarma with goat meat today, I hated it. I finished Dracula and the ending sucked. 

The weather is getting pretty good so meaning I can practice my recorder outside again (finally), and I actually even want to go out more. Today I went to a beach and it wasn't as great as I expected.

Write to me about your April and plans for this month. 
xoxo
