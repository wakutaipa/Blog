## My Last Week Of March

Hey reader! This month just flew by so fast. I've been so caught up doing schoolwork and practicing my hobbies.

In the last week of March, I started reading 'Dracula' by Bram Stocker and it's really good. I also started playing the recorder (I can play baby shark and lavendar's blue). 
I visited the atom exibit at Vdnkh and learnt about nuclear reactors and so much more, Iwish I could have taken you along with me. Besides that I had a math-analysis test which turned out to not be as bad as I expected.

That actually sums up my week. This would be way better as a video so look out for my vlogs on youtube lol. 

Have a good one!
